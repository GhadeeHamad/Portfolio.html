<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Just recently figured out my passion for programing! which was a very far thing to me in my opinion.<br/>
but I got into this amazing world and happily learning & evolving in it! <br/>
Also designing is a hobby I enjoy, so planning to combine all of my passions<br/>
 through programing & explore my abilities <br/>
to also create helpfull programs for the world. </p>
